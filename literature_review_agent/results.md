### Summary
The study introduces the "R\'io Hortega University Hospital Glioblastoma Dataset (RHUH-GBM)," addressing limitations in existing public MRI repositories for glioblastoma research. RHUH-GBM comprises multiparametric MRI scans, volumetric measurements, molecular profiles, and survival data from patients who underwent total or near-total tumor resection. Notably, it includes expert-validated segmentations of tumor subregions, providing high-quality ground truth for developing postoperative and longitudinal MRI analysis algorithms. By making this comprehensive dataset publicly available, the resource facilitates in-depth investigation of recurrence patterns and the creation of advanced diagnostic and prognostic models, ultimately supporting the development of more personalized and effective therapeutic strategies for glioblastoma patients.

## Conclusion
This literature review highlights the significant progress in the field and identifies areas for future research.
