### Summary
The RÃ­o Hortega University Hospital Glioblastoma Dataset (RHUH-GBM) addresses limitations in existing public MRI repositories by providing a comprehensive collection of multiparametric MRI scans, volumetric measurements, molecular data, and survival information for glioblastoma patients who underwent total or near-total enhancing tumor resection. This dataset includes expert-corrected segmentations of various tumor subregions, serving as high-quality ground truth for developing and validating algorithms aimed at postoperative and longitudinal MRI analyses. By making RHUH-GBM publicly available, the dataset facilitates advanced research into glioblastoma recurrence patterns and supports the development of innovative diagnostic and prognostic models. Ultimately, this resource has the potential to enable more personalized and effective treatment strategies, thereby improving patient outcomes in this highly aggressive brain tumor.

## Conclusion
This literature review highlights the significant progress in the field and identifies areas for future research.
